BackNode
========

POC for [CIFACOM](http://www.cifacom.com/) Week project

## First step

With this project, you can work directly online with some **cloud service**, or on **localhost**, as you wish.

*If you don't want to use these tool's at all (Hooo -_-") jump to the second step -> clone and build the project*

In order to use these services, you need to sign up on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) (**required**) you must create a account on github (if you have not one yet !) in order to work on this project and fork them

- [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) (**optional**) you can signing with your GitHub / Bitbucket account if you have one, your project will be accessible from your dashboard then

**GitHub** will be our online versionned working copy

and

**Cloud9** will be our working station (node virtual machine, working IDE, testing server, etc...)

or

**localhost / bash** hmmm i like black screen :)


When you have created your account, if you want try Cloud9, please go to your Cloud9 dashboard, and create a new workspace, then start editing it.

# Clone and build the project

First, you need to fork the project from the original repository. Click on the *Fork* button on the top right corner of main project page.

When it's done, clone it !

If you are not in Cloud9, open a terminal, otherwise, you have a opened terminal in your cloud9 window, at the bottom. If they not, you can show it with *Tools > show console* **or** *Tools > terminal > new terminal*

clone the project:

    > git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_ACCOUNT]/BackNode.git && cd BackNode

Ok it's done, you can now build the project and start to work !

## Build the project

just enter make in your terminal :)

    > make

this make command will create folder's ./www/template, our user's custom template directory
install npm dependencies (express / unifile, but other if you want -> package.json)
and run the project (src/app.js)

for this project, we want to use [unifile](https://www.npmjs.org/package/unifile) more details on functional spech tech ;)

but as you can see, it's an empty project, choose you own dependencies and make us dream with your technical choice !

## Test

if you are on localhost, project will be accessible from **http://localhost:8080**

if you are on **Cloud9**, abort the node process, and click on the **run & debug** icon (top left), create your own profile or go on app.js and dbl click on the active file (run & debug section), your project will be accessible from outside, you can find your project's url on the output panel:

    https://[PROJECT]-c9-[YOUR_ACCOUNT].c9.io

## Deploy / Git / Pull request

when your feature it's done and you wants to merge it into the main repo, commit your modification in your forked repo, then create a **pull request to silexlabs/BackNode**. I will try to check soon as possible your pull request, do some comment's or not and merge it. Then, i deploy your modification on heroku server :

    http://nodejs-cms.herokuapp.com

the project must be **stable** when you create your pull request
